With dictionaries, we can remove an key-value pair, add a new key-value pair, or overwrite an existing key-value pair whenever we want. Keys can be many things, but often you will see them as a string. Values can be strings, lists, other dictionaries (as seen below for the heatmaps), etc. Nested dictionaries can be complicated to intuit, but they can be a good way to associate a bunch of information together easily, coding-wise.
